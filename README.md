## **Tech Stack**

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a declarative way of writing UI components, making the code easy to understand and manage.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework to quickly build custom designs. It helps you avoid writing repetitive CSS by providing a set of utility classes that you apply directly in your JSX code.
- **Node.js (Optional)**: For backend integration (could be used for hosting or an API). This can be expanded upon for future work, such as handling form submissions or serving dynamic content.
- **React Router**: (Optional) For navigation, if you decide to extend the website with multiple dynamic routes.

## **Getting Started**

This section covers the steps required to set up the portfolio on your local machine, run it locally, and build for production.

### **Installation**

To get started with this portfolio, you will need to have **Node.js** installed. If you haven't already, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps to install the required dependencies:

1. Clone the repository (or create a new React project):
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app miles-portfolio
   cd miles-portfolio
   ```

2. Install **Tailwind CSS** and the necessary tools for PostCSS:
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

3. Tailwind needs to be configured. Open the `tailwind.config.js` file and replace it with the following:

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
       "./public/index.html",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
